# GSM Based Temperature Monitoring System-


The objective of the project is to design a system that monitors the temperature of a room and sends an
SMS in one of two cases:  
● The temperature exceeds a level (Temperature Threshold).  
● The temperature rise rate exceeds a rate specified by the user (Temperature Rate Threshold).  
The system allows the user to specify both the Temperature Threshold and Temperature Rate Threshold.  
The resolution with which Temperature Threshold can be specified is at most 2℃ or less. The resolution
with which the Temperature Threshold Rate is set to be 5℃/min or less. The range in which Temperature
Rate threshold exists is about [35℃ - 90℃] or more.  
The main Function of the project is built on how to combine individual components that have a specified
job together with the atmega32 to get the achieve its overall goal.  
The combined system should satisfy these requirements:  
1- Allow the user to specify the limits.  
2- Monitor the temperature continuously.  
3- Show current temperature.  
4- Send an SMS to the user when the temperature is out of range or if the rate exceeds limits.
